<p>Current stable version of Dart:
<span class="editor-build-rev-stable">[calculating]</span></p>

Install the Dart SDK to get everything you need to write and run Dart code:
VM, libraries, analyzer, package manager, doc generator,
formatter, debugger, and more.

If you are doing web development, you will also need **Dartium**.
Instructions for installing Dartium are also provided in the following pages,
or see the [zip file archive](/install/archive/).

## Automated installation and updates

A package manager can help you easily install and update the Dart SDK.

* [Installing Dart on Windows](windows) with Chocolatey or a
  Windows installer
* [Installing Dart on Mac](mac) with homebrew
* [Installing Dart on Linux](linux) with our Debian package

## Manual install

Not using a package manager for your OS? No problem!

[Download](archive/)
zip files of the Dart SDK, Dartium, and docs.

## Looking for an older version?
